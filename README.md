# gtreg-talk-phuse-2023

A 20 minute in person talk for the Open Source Technologies section of the [2023 PHUSE conference](https://www.phuse-events.org/attend/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=9346&ef_sel_menu=876&eventID=18) in Orlando, FL.

# Abstract

{gtreg} streamlines production of regulatory tables in clinical research. There are three functions to assist with adverse event reporting: `tbl_ae_count()`, `tbl_ae()`, and `tbl_ae_focus()`; `tbl_ae_count()` tabulates all AEs observed, whereas both `tbl_ae()` and `tbl_ae_focus()` count a single AE per subject by maximum grade. Furthermore, `tbl_reg_summary()` produces standard data summary tables often used in regulatory submissions and `tbl_listing()` enables a formatted grouped printing of raw AE listings. As {gtreg} is built off of {gtsummary}, is built off of {gt}, all tables are highly customizable to make your regulatory reporting a breeze!
